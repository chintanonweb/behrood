                <p>Behrood Pharmaceutical Company was established in 1375 by a group of experienced pharmacists. By
                    joining a team of experienced veterinarian doctors, the company started its work with the
                    production of a type of oral antibiotic for poultry. From the beginning of its work, Behroud
                    Pharmaceuticals experienced extensive cooperation with European and American veterinary medicine
                    manufacturers to supply raw materials and licensed products or produce under the brand name of
                    well-known companies in this industry. These collaborations took place both in the field of
                    supplying raw materials and in the field of technical inspections by foreign experts from the
                    collection of production parts and laboratories of Behrood company, so that before the start of
                    the American sanctions against Iran, many of the raw materials of Behrood pharmaceuticals were
                    supplied by companies such as Eli Lilly (Alanco , America), Pfizer (USA), Introit (Netherlands),
                    Hoofarma (Bulgaria), BASF (Germany), Schering Plav (USA) and some reputable Indian and Chinese
                    companies.</p>
                <p>
                    The experience of long-term cooperation with the veterinary pharmaceutical companies
                    of the world has made Behrood Company to become one of the most reliable, regular and well-known
                    domestic suppliers of veterinary drugs in Iran and neighboring countries after a quarter of a
                    century.
